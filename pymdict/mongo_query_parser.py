        """
        Transforms the given request in a mongo query

        :param str_query: String containing the query.

        A request is a set of conditions that elements must satisfy. For example, if we have the following dictionary:

        {
            "father": { "name": "foo", "age": 44},
            "mother": { "name": "bar", "age": 41},
            "sister": { "name": "foobar", "age": 19}
        }

        and it is wanted to get the element with name "foo", it can be done as follows:

            value.name eq "foo"

        This query will return the "father" element.

        Queries can be combined in such a way to make complex queries. Example:

            value.name eq "foo" or (value.age > 40 and value.age < 50)

        This query returns the "father" and "mother" elements.

        Available operators are:

            eq               equals for comparing text
            =                equals for comparing numbers
            !                negation, can be prepended to eq and =, for example: !eq and !=
            >                greater than a number
            <                lesser than a number
            >=               greater or equal than a number
            <=               lesser or equal than a number
            %                Regex match
            !%               Regex not match
            in               in a list of values

            or               To join two conditions in OR
            and              To join two conditions in AND
